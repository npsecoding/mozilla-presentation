Good Afternoon Everyone.

My Name is Nancy Pang and I'm an intern on the Platform Accessibility Team.
I'd like to start off my presentation talking about Ramps.

Ramps

It's a structure we've all seen.
They've existed since 2600 B.C.E, an essential tool created by the Ancient Egyptians to improve the accessibility of stone blocks.
Ramps allowed massive stones to be raised and transported easily making the construction of The Great Pyramid of Giza, a World Wonder, possible.
The Ancient Egyptians realized the impact of accessible design, it made life easier and dreams possible.

As Tim Cook says:
"Accessibility rights are human rights"
Fast forward to today and accessiblity is becoming more ingrained in our culture.
Many states and provinces businesses have an obligation to make their facilities accessible by law.

The web is relatively new and doesn't have the same rigourus laws/restrictions that the physical world has.
According to WHO "About 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability"
To put that number in perspective that's about 1 billion people.
1 billion people who have a difficult time understanding, navigating, and interacting or contributing to the Web.
That's a huge loss of human potential and this number is only growing as people age motor skills, vision and hearing degrade.

PROJECT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This summer I had the oppurtunity to make Firefox Devtools more Accessible and learned a new way to navigate the web.
Worked on bug fixes to improve the sightless navigation experience and a tool to evaluate the accessibility of a site.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGHTED WEB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do we do when we visit a site we're not familiar with?
- Eyes scan across the top of the page looking for important shortcuts/navigation links
- Scan through content looking for headlines, bolded/highlighted text
- Pictures/Videos

We have the freedom to look around.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGHTLESS WEB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do we do when we visit a site we're not familiar with?
- Use Keyboard to navigate to different areas on the page
- Only know the current area, don't know surrounding


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOOL:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Show TWITTER.COM TAB NAVIGATION
Sightless Internet:
- There is no looking, random scanning
- Keyboard navigation is structured from top to bottom
- (Screen Reader) Text to speech reading out accessible information for the current element
- Information is provided by properties set by developer

Purpose of tool:
Easy recognition: Allow developers with disabilities to quickly identify elements by exposing key information
Fast Evaluation: Provide developers interested in accessible design with a fast way to test and improve their website design

Workflow of Tool:
Show Picture of feature.
Accessibility Panel outlined in red lives inside the inspector of Firefox Dev Tools.
First the developer selects a Dom Node shown in yellow then the tool displays accessible properties in the panel.
